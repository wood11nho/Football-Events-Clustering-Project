# Football Events Clustering Project

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to a dataset of football match events. The primary goal is to explore clustering methods to identify meaningful patterns and insights from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/secareanualin/football-events/data), contains detailed information about football events, including numerical and categorical features.

## Methods
We will implement and compare the following clustering models:
- **OPTICS**: A density-based clustering algorithm.
- **BIRCH**: A hierarchical clustering algorithm designed for large datasets.

## Objectives
1. Preprocess the dataset and explore its characteristics.
2. Apply the selected clustering models.
3. Evaluate and interpret the clustering results.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/football-events-clustering.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the clustering scripts to explore the results.
